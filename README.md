## Overview
This is the authors' implementation of Expression Training App described in:  
Mirror Mirror: Crowdsourcing Better Portraits

This App is used for training users to mimic their best expressions. The App takes input from a webcam/video and displays the current expression along with its attractiveness and seriousness scores, computed in real-time.  The user can specify a target expression to mimic. The App then shows three windows; the current expression, the target expression, and an aligned and a blended cross-fade between the two. The cross-fade oscillates between the target and current expression once per two seconds, so that the subject can examine differences between the two expressions. See Section 6 in the original paper for details.

This software includes two modules:  
(1) Learning attractive/serious SVM models given expressions and annotations.  
(2) Expression Training App.  

The code can only be used for non-commercial purposes. Please cite our paper if you use our code and data for your research.


## Third party libraries
* OpenCV:  
  - sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
* OpenGL and GLUT:  
  - sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev  
  - sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev libxi-dev  
* HOG feature code (included)  
* CLM Tracker by Jason Saragih (included)  
* LIBSVM (included)  


## Installation (Linux)
* Download and unzip the code.
* mkdir cbuild
* cd cbuild
* cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
* make


## Quick Examples
An example for learning attractive/serious svm models:  
./MirrorMirror -m 0 ./data/test/ ./data/models/

An example for Expression Training App using trained model and video file:  
./MirrorMirror -m 1 -i ./data/video.avi ./data/target.png ./data/models/

An example for Expression Training App using cross-subject model and webcam:  
./MirrorMirror -m 1 your/target/image/ ./models/svm/


## Command Usage ([ ] : options)
Command line interface: ./MirrorMirror [-v verbose] [-m mode] [-i input_video] [-s save_dir] data_file model_dir  

-v verbose: shows details about the runtime output (default = 1)  
  - 0 -- no output  
  - 1 -- some output  

-m mode: set the training mode (default = 0)  
  - 0 -- learning attractive/serious svm models  
  - 1 -- expression training App  

-i input_video: specify the video input; if no video is specified, the program will use a webcam.  

-s save_dir: specify the directory where the results will be saved.  

data_file: set the directory/path of the input data:  
- if m = 0, data_file specifies the directory of images and scores used for SVM training;
- if m = 1, data_file is the path of the selected target expression.  

model_dir: set the directory for svm models.
 - Cross-subject svm models trained on 11 subjects are included: ./models/svm


## User Interaction
1. The program displays three windows:  
   - The "Target Expression" window shows the target expression selected by the user.
   - The "Current Expression" window shows the current expression either from video or from a webcam.
   - The "MirrorMirror" window shows an aligned and a blended cross-fade between the target. It also shows the attractiveness and seriousness scores of current expression.

2. User Interaction: "MirrorMirror" window takes the user's keyboard input.
   - 's':  start the tracker.  
   - 'r':  restart the tracker if the tracker fails.  
   - 'p':  save the current expression  
   - 'd':  pause the system to see fine-grained differences at a frozen moment of time.
   - 'q':  quite the program


## Training Data Preparation
The training data directory should contain:  
(1) /imgs/: expression images.  
(2) /scores/: attractive/serious scores  
(3) /image.txt: image list. See "./data/test/" for an example.
